## University of Bristol Statistical Machine Learning  
This reading group focuses on the geometry of optimal transport and information and their application in machine learning(e.g. flow/diffusion-based model or sampling scheme). The main reference:   
[Statistical optimal transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18163) -  Sinho Chewi et al.   
[Log-concave Sampling](https://chewisinho.github.io/main.pdf) - Sinho Chewi    
[Information geometry and its application](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-4-431-55978-8) - Shun-ichi Amari    
Also here is the reference for the foundations on Riemannian geometry:      
[Riemannian Geometry](https://ia800300.us.archive.org/16/items/topology-collection/Riemannian%20Geometry%20-%20M.%20doCarmo_text.pdf) - Do Carmo     
A short recap of information geometry can also be found in [Information geometry mechanisms behind maximising channel capacity](https://github.com/probabilityFLOW/Geometry-reading-group/blob/main/Mini_Project_1.4.pdf) by Kieran.
